# MyGame
3D game in c++ using openGL

Tesing the waters with openGL in c++

My goal is to create an engine that allows for:
  - basic movement in 3D space (no-clip)
  - basic rendering features (like depth testing, ambient/diffuse/specular lighting, global-illumination(?))
  - texture rendering
  - collision detection / gravity
  - basic ai (follow, wander, turn-to)
  - basic level editor
